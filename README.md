Getting Started

Installation:

If you haven't already, install the project's dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn:

Bash
npm install
Use code with caution.

This will ensure all necessary libraries are available for the application to run correctly.

Running the Application:

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running:

Bash
npm start


This will typically launch the application in your default web browser, usually at http://localhost:3000/ or a similar address.
